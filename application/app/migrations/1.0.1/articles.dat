The move makes Twitter one of the best-known tech platforms so far to launch a feature for the flashy NFT trend. NFTs, or \'nonfungible tokens,\' are one-of-a-kind, verifiable digital collectibles, often works of art, that can be traded on the blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. While not exactly new, NFTs have exploded into a lucrative industry over the past year, with digital art works selling for millions of dollars, and artists, celebrities and companies jumping on board to make and sell them. NFTs such as characters from the popular \'Bored Apes\' collection have been popping up as people\'s avatars on Twitter (TWTR) in recent months. The new feature, which is only available to users who pay for Twitter\'s subscription service, will go a step further. It will verify someone\'s ownership of the NFT by linking the person\'s digital wallet where the NFTs are stored to their Twitter account.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1640282693216-0daee44dab75?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80,"2021-09-12 08:00:00","2022-01-24 06:49:08"
